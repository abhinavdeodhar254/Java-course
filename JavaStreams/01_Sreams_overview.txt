* stream has a source. That is from where the data elements are     coming form.
# All the pipelines start from the stram (Stream()).
There are many kind of sources for the stream one of them is also called as infinite stream.

# Every stream pipelines ends in the terminal operations. This terminal operation either produces a results or a side effect.
# Everything that is between the stream source and the terminal operation is a intermediate operation.

# <IMPORTANT>
# Streams are lazy because the computations on the source data is only performed when the teerminal opertaion is initiated.

# The elements inside the source are consumed only as they are needed according to the terminal operations.

# We can write the terminal operation right after all the listed intermediate operations or even after some lines. 

# Stream can be consumed only once.
#This means that we can't perform more than one terminal operation on the stream.

# Stream starts executing the intermediate operations only when the compiler comes across the terminal operation.
