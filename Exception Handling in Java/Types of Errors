Exception Handling.

exception -> Run time errors.

#type of errors:

1.Syntax error:->
example is missing a semi colon. Compiler will identify these errors. Systax error avoids compiler to convert the code to the byte code.

2.Logical error:-.
Syntactically  correct but not getting expected results. 

3. Run time Errors:-> (external errors)
Faced by users. Based on mishandling of program. 
Cause= bad input or unavalability of resources. Programmer needs to take care at the time of building the application.



this runtime errors are handled by exception handling.
syntax error by compiler
logical error by debugger.


when Exception occurs the program gets terminated. As we want the program should not terminate and run the remaining part we handle the exception.

consider the program below:

        class test{
            int i=5;
            int b=0;
            int c;
            c=i/b   //this will give infinite but in programming it is an exception. the program will terminate here and nothing below this will get executed. We need to avoid this from happening.

            sysout("We want to execute this statement even it is exvception");

            sysout("End program smoothly);
        }
