//There are two types of exceptions;
checked excepions: always need to manage by try catch block.
file not found exception.

unchecked exception: not compulsory to manage by try and catch block.
example; arethematic exception, array out of bound, null pointer exception.


Methods of Exception;

1. String getMessage():
to print the exception message using system.out.println(e.getMessage);

2. String toString():
to print the exception message using the System.out.println(e);
this implementation is different from the above.

3.void printStackTrace():


// method2(){
//     // here the ecxception was raised.
// }
// method1(){
//     method2(); //method 1 is calling method 2
// }
// main(){
//     method1()  //main is calling method 1
// }

// so to know the stack trace of which method was called and where was
// the exception raised this printStackTrace() method is used.

we use it in the following way:
// e.printStackTrace();

We can also create our own exceptions from the exception class.
the return type will be String

//public LowBalanceException extends Exception(){
//          public string toString(){
//                  system.out.println("balance is less than 5000");
//          }
// }

// So now whenever we will use this exception the following message will be printed
